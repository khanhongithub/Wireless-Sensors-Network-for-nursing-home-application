# Wireless-Sensors-Network-for-nursing-home-application

In this repo, a health monitoring system for
nursing home implemented by wireless sensor network is
proposed. The monitoring system is designed to monitoring the
heart beat rate of the patients moving in the yard, the sensor
node will send the gateway an alarm when abnormal value
detected. The network is self-organised and topology change
tolerated. Besides, the system is able to obtain the environment
information like the temperature, humidity and windspeed. A
gateway is built to collect and display all the information
obtained from the system.
